# Project Title:
Optimizing Order Fulfillment: A Data-Driven Approach to Eliminate Backlogs with an Excel Interactive Dashboard

# Company Overview
Streamline Logistics Solutions is a fast-growing logistics and delivery company specializing in order fulfillment across multiple zones. The company coordinates a fleet of vans, bikes, and trucks to ensure efficient last-mile delivery. As a service-driven organization, Streamline Logistics prioritizes customer satisfaction, operational excellence, and real-time visibility into logistics performance.

## Problem Statement
Despite a functional delivery operation, the company faced significant challenges in its supply chain processes, including rising backlogs, delivery delays, inefficient resource allocation, and lack of visibility into order progress. These inefficiencies threatened customer satisfaction, increased operational costs, and risked damaging the companyâ€™s industry reputation.

## Aim and Purpose of the Project
The goal of this project was to develop a robust, Excel-based interactive dashboard to streamline order fulfillment and improve decision-making. The dashboard would serve as a central tool for tracking key metrics, optimizing resource deployment, identifying performance bottlenecks, and enhancing communication. Ultimately, the project aimed to eliminate backlogs, reduce delivery delays, and support strategic planning with actionable insights.

# Data Cleaning and Automation Process
To ensure accuracy and reliability in the analysis, raw logistics data was first cleaned and structured using Excel Power Query. This involved:

Removing duplicates and filtering incomplete or irrelevant records.

Standardizing date and time formats to calculate delivery durations accurately.

Normalizing location and driver data for consistency across entries.

Handling missing values through logical imputation and validation.

After cleaning, key performance indicators (KPIs) such as order completion rate, average delivery time, and delay frequency were automated using advanced Excel formulas and named ranges.

Additionally, Office Scripts were used to auto-generate weekly KPI summary reports with visualizations, streamlining repetitive reporting tasks and saving manual effort.

# Interactive Excel-based Bashboard
An interactive Excel-based dashboard was developed to present real-time insights into order fulfillment performance. 

The dashboard featured:

- Dynamic charts and pivot tables for visualizing trends in delivery times, order volumes, and zone-based performance.

- Slicers and dropdown filters to allow users to drill down by date, driver, delivery zone, and transport method.

- Conditional formatting to highlight performance issues such as delays, backlogs, and underperforming drivers.

- Automated refresh features for up-to-date data visualization with every data import.

These visualizations enhanced decision-making by transforming raw data into intuitive, actionable insights tailored to operations and logistics management.
